# Ryujin-SMHW
v1.0.6a

## Installation
Run `git clone https://github.com/edqx/Ryujin-SMHW` in a command prompt in a directory of your choice.

## Setup
Run `cd Ryujin-SMHW` then `npm install` to install all dependencies, which I have tried to keep as little as possible so it should be a quick download.

Then create a `login.json` in the created repository folder with the following information provided:
```json
{
    "school": 0,
    "username": "email or username",
    "password": "password"
}
```
With `school` being the school ID, the username being your email or username and password being the password to your account.

## Execution
Just run `npm start` and it should just run. If you encounter any issues, make 
sure to open an issue on this repository.

## Update
To update the application, go to the created repository folder in a command prompt and enter `git pull`. This should automatically fetch all updates and be ready for use, you do not need to download dependencies again or enter login information.

## Notices
You can use this application but note that it is very much incomplete and has very few features, although I am working on it quite a lot.

I do not host a server for this so all handling of your data is done on client side and client side only. It is safe to enter your credentials.

I will not be held responsible with anything you do using this application.
